1. css/
Contains:

bootstrap.css — The full, unminified CSS source file with all Bootstrap styles.

bootstrap.min.css — The minified (compressed) version optimized for production (smaller file size).

Sometimes there are source maps (.map files) for debugging.

Purpose:
This folder contains all the stylesheets needed for Bootstrap’s layout, components, utilities, and responsive grid system.
When you link bootstrap.min.css in your HTML, you get all Bootstrap's default styling applied to your page.

2. js/
Contains:

bootstrap.bundle.js — The full, unminified JavaScript bundle file that includes Bootstrap’s JavaScript plugins and Popper.js (needed for tooltips, dropdowns, etc.).

bootstrap.bundle.min.js — The minified, compressed version of the bundle for production.

bootstrap.js and bootstrap.min.js — Same as above but without Popper.js bundled in (you’d need to include Popper separately if you use these).

Source maps (.map files) for debugging.

Purpose:
This folder holds all the JavaScript files that power Bootstrap’s interactive components like modals, tooltips, carousels, dropdown menus, collapse elements, and more.
The bundle versions include Popper.js (a dependency for positioning tooltips and dropdowns), so you don’t need extra script tags for Popper if you use these.

3. icons/
Contains:

Bootstrap Icons in SVG format and possibly other formats.

Usually files like .svg and CSS or fonts for the icon set.

Purpose:
This folder contains the Bootstrap Icons library, which is a separate project by Bootstrap providing open-source SVG icons designed to work seamlessly with Bootstrap.
You can use these icons in your web projects for UI elements like buttons, alerts, navigation, and more.
To use them, you either include the CSS provided here or directly use the SVG files inline or as images.
